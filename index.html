			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Mughal dynasty, Mughal also spelled Mogul, Persian Mughūl (“Mongol”), Muslim dynasty of Turkic-Mongol origin that ruled most of northern India from the early 16th to the mid-18th century.After that time it continued to exist as a considerably reduced and increasingly powerless entity until the mid-19th century. The Mughal dynasty was notable for its more than two centuries of effective rule over much of India; for the ability of its rulers, who through seven generations maintained a record of unusual talent; and for its administrative organization. A further distinction was the attempt of the Mughals, who were Muslims, to integrate Hindus and Muslims into a united Indian state.</p>

			<h2>Timeline</h2>
			<p>At its height, a period extending from the middle of the 16th century to the beginning of the 18th, the Mughal Empire controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent, marshaling vast amounts of money and manpower.The best-known members of the Mughal dynasty are its first emperors—Babur and five of his lineal descendants: Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. These six emperors are sometimes collectively known as the Great Mughals, and the military, artistic, and political glories of the empire are inextricably connected to their individual biographies.</p>
